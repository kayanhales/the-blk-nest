# The BLK Nest 🪹

The BLK Nest is a community-driven directory and resource hub for Black families.  
Our mission is simple: **make it easier to find trusted providers, resources, and support built with us in mind.**

This project exists because too often, Black families face barriers to culturally competent, affirming, and accessible care.  
The BLK Nest is here to change that — one contribution at a time.

## 🌱 Why This Exists

- To help Black families find **trusted providers** (pediatricians, nannies, pelvic floor therapists, and more)  
- To gather and share **resources** that uplift our health, education, culture, and community  
- To build a **village** where information is freely accessible and maintained by us, for us  

Every submission helps another family. Every resource shared strengthens the community.
